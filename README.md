# hackathon_21


For the starters we have created a website called ‘Heritage 21’ using the tools of the front-end programming languages like CSS and HTML. The main homepage of the website consists of 4 pop-up images with encrypted link to the pop-up box which displays the information of the particular topic when we click on it. Different pictures  depicts the different areas or heading for the generational heritage. explanation like:
•	First pop up image takes us to the multiple sub headings for the topic of generational heritage i.e: 1. Monumental heritage 2. Computational heritage 3. Mechanical heritage.
•	Second pop-up images take us to the sub heading of preservation of heritage.
•	Third pop-up image takes us to the contribution of past heritage for future inspirations.
•	Similarly, the fourth one takes us to the sustainability of the heritage.
